// scripts/build-sequence-compiled.mjs — B1167200
//
// THE PROBLEM (measured on the owner's own machine, BACKLOG.md B1167200): the Schedule tab
// (public/sequence/index.html) ships its ~17,000-line app as JSX inside two
// <script type="text/babel"> blocks and transpiles all of it, on the main thread, on EVERY
// load, via @babel/standalone pulled from a CDN — a single ~2.3s blocking task at boot on a
// real machine, ~2.26s of it main-thread-blocking. React and ReactDOM were also loaded from a
// CDN at runtime.
//
// THE FIX, and why it is a BUILD step rather than a source edit: public/sequence/index.html
// stays exactly what it has always been — the hand-authored source, with both
// <script type="text/babel"> blocks intact — because at least fifteen call sites (tests, a
// formula-engine sync script, several e2e specs) depend on that file being a real,
// non-importable, in-browser-Babel document with those exact markers. Converting it to ES
// modules or moving it under src/ would break all of them for no reason: the fix this item
// needs is about what gets SERVED, not about how the file is authored.
//
// So: this script runs AFTER `vite build` (wired into `npm run build`, see package.json) and
// reads the untouched source, transpiles both <script type="text/babel"> blocks to plain JS
// with esbuild (reusing checkBabelBlocks' own walk + transform from
// ui-audit/stress/check-babel.mjs — no second parser), replaces each block with a plain
// <script> holding the compiled code, drops the @babel/standalone <script> tag, and overwrites
// `vite build`'s verbatim public/-copy of dist/sequence/index.html with the result. Nothing
// else about the page changes: same markup, same other <script> blocks (the seeded
// window.__PLANAR_DATA__, the formula engine, the save-queue IIFE), same execution order.
//
// React/ReactDOM stopped being loaded from cdnjs at runtime in the SOURCE file itself (a plain
// <script src> swap, unrelated to the babel blocks) — they're vendored locally at
// public/sequence/vendor/react*.production.min.js (copied from this repo's own pinned `react`/
// `react-dom` npm packages, kept in lock-step by using the same dependency the rest of the app
// already builds against). That happens for both dev and prod, so this script does not need to
// touch it.
//
// Usage:  node scripts/build-sequence-compiled.mjs           (reads public/, writes dist/)
//         node scripts/build-sequence-compiled.mjs --check   (compiles + validates only, writes nothing)
