/* B1399568 — "Planning a site on ground that already has a project mints a second project."
 *
 * Production repro: a single account minted TWO projects 51 seconds apart at byte-identical
 * origin coordinates via the map's "Start blank" path. Two mechanisms fix it — see
 * projectModel.js's findProjectAtOrigin (FINDING A, ADOPT instead of mint) and MapFinder.jsx's
 * startBlankHereBusyRef/decideBusyRef (FINDING B, an in-flight guard). FINDING A is exhaustively
 * unit-tested in test/duplicateProjectOrigin.test.js against the exact production coordinates
 * (proven RED on unfixed code before GREEN on the fix) — an end-to-end proof of it here would
 * need two genuinely SEPARATE visits landing on the same ground, and this sandbox has no reliable
 * way to drive that: real parcel selection needs live GIS (every county host is egress-blocked
 * here), and the map's own re-landing between visits (landingView.js's single-site fit) does NOT
 * reproduce a byte-identical or even near-identical origin — measured directly, it can land the
 * map centre well outside findProjectAtOrigin's SAME_GROUND_FT tolerance. A SEPARATE, unrelated
 * bug was also found while probing this (see the NOTICED note below) that blocks a scripted
 * "return to map, same session" route too.
 *
 * What IS reliably provable live, headless, right here, is FINDING B: `startBlankHere` awaits a
 * county lookup (up to 3s) before it ever hands off to `newBlankSite`, which itself awaits a team
 * resolution before writing — a real, multi-second window during which the "Draw" button stays on
 * screen, live and clickable, with nothing yet indicating a plan is being created. Two presses
 * fired back-to-back while that button is still visible land INSIDE that window, before the first
 * press's own `saveSite` has run — the in-flight guard (`startBlankHereBusyRef`), not the
 * ground-adopt check, is what has to catch this one, and it's exactly the shape this spec drives.
 *
 * ⛔ NOTICED, NOT CHASED, NOT THIS ITEM'S — a genuine, separate navigation bug found while
 * building this spec: clicking the Site Planner header's "Map" breadcrumb (AppHeader's
 * `onDashboard` → SitePlannerApp's `goMap`) right after creating a brand-new project does NOT
 * leave the plan — the header still shows the just-created project's breadcrumb chips
 * afterward, and the map toolbar never becomes visible. This reads as the same class of bounce-
 * back SitePlannerApp.jsx's own B881664 comments describe (a route-effect re-asserting the
 * project before the mode switch has fully settled), on a path B881664's own fix apparently
 * doesn't cover. Not investigated further and not folded into this fix — unrelated to duplicate
 * project creation, and STANDING RULE #3 says one task per session. Worth its own item if picked
 * up: repro is "create a new project via 'Start blank', then click the header's Map crumb."
