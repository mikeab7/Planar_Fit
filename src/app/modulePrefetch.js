/* modulePrefetch — warm a workspace before the user opens it, so the tab click
 * feels instant without regressing initial boot. (B223)
 *
 * Two costs are warmed:
 *   1. The lazy JS chunk for the workspace (same dynamic-import specifier the
 *      Shell's React.lazy uses, so the browser dedupes to one chunk request).
 *   2. For Schedule specifically, the heavy standalone Gantt document
 *      (public/sequence/index.html) that its iframe loads — warmed with
 *      <link rel="prefetch"> so the iframe boots from cache on navigation.
 *
 *      ⛔ SIZE, CORRECTED (B1167201, 2026-09-07) — this comment previously said "~692 KB",
 *      which was stale by ~76%: the authored source is 1,247,423 bytes (~1.2 MB) and had grown
 *      to that size with nobody updating the number here. What THIS prefetch actually warms is
 *      the served document at `/sequence/`, which since B1167200 (the build-time Babel-compile
 *      step that removes the in-browser JSX transpile) is the dist-built, comment-stripped
 *      version — measured 1,063,908 bytes (~1.04 MB) in that build. `npm run dev` still serves
 *      the raw ~1.2 MB authored source unchanged (B1167200 deliberately only transforms the
 *      production build output, not dev — see that script's own header), so the two sizes
 *      genuinely differ; ~1.04 MB is the number that matters here since this warming path only
 *      runs against what's actually deployed.
 *
 *      Still the right call at this size: a single `as="document"` prefetch, gated on real
 *      navigation intent (hover/pointerdown below), is exactly the shape the browser's own
 *      prefetch mechanism is for — it runs at low priority and doesn't compete with the active
 *      route's critical path, so growing from 692 KB (never true) to ~1.04 MB doesn't change
 *      the tradeoff. No behavior change here, only the number.
 *
 * ⛔ INTENT-DRIVEN ONLY — never warm at boot (NEW-9). B223 originally also warmed
 * scheduler + doc-review + library from a boot `requestIdleCallback`. Measurement on
 * production (2026-07-28, Sylvestri/Concept C) showed that idle callback firing at
 * ~t=304ms — BEFORE first-contentful-paint at ~328ms — so the "runs only after first
 * paint" assumption was simply false: requestIdleCallback fires in any gap in the main
 * thread, including gaps *during* boot while the network is still delivering the
 * critical path. The result was that a Site-only session fetched all 11 chunks, pulling
 * ~805 KB raw (~27% of all JS: pdf.worker 460 · DocReview 187 · Library 91 · uploadQueue
 * 33 · Scheduler 15 · folders 14 · pdf 5) that it never executes — and, worse, `import()`
 * fetches at HIGH priority and then EVALUATES the module, spending main-thread
 * parse/compile time in exactly the window the planner needs to become interactive.
 *
 * So warming is now driven purely by NAVIGATION INTENT, from AppHeader's module tabs:
 * `onMouseEnter` (pointer aiming at the tab) and `onPointerDown` (the touch/tap path,
 * which has no hover). Both land well before the click commits, so switching still feels
 * instant, while a session that never leaves the Site route pays nothing. The accepted
 * tradeoff is a short chunk fetch on the first open for a user who taps a tab with no
 * preceding hover or pointerdown gap.
 *
 * Every call is idempotent and best-effort.
