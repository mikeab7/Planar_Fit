/* IntegrityBanner — the two findings nothing could previously mention (B315715, B342992).
 *
 * ⛔ IT IS ITS OWN LAZY CHUNK, and that is a measured bundle decision rather than tidiness.
 * The bar renders only when there is a real finding, which is almost never — so on the
 * overwhelming majority of loads its bytes would be downloaded before the notebook rail can
 * paint, for a component nobody sees. Same reasoning as the editor and Quick Open. It is
 * pulled in from Notes.jsx behind a Suspense with a null fallback: a bar that arrives a
 * moment late is exactly as useful, and a rail that paints a moment sooner is the thing this
 * route's byte budget exists to protect.

/** ⛔ THE SAME NOTE IN TWO PROJECTS, AND A NOTE THAT WAS FILED NOWHERE — SAID OUT LOUD.
 *
 *  Two findings, one bar, and each one exists because the product had no way to mention
 *  something it already knew:
 *
 *  • A NOTE IN TWO PROJECTS (NEW-4, prior round). Copied into an unrelated pursuit, found by
 *    hand a week later under a tombstone heading.
 *  • A NOTE WITH NO NODE (NEW-1). The first version of this bar said "One note is filed in no
 *    project and reachable from nowhere" — a correct finding, rendered useless: it named no
 *    note, opened nothing and offered no action, so the only thing a person could do with it
 *    was worry. It now NAMES each one (its first line, when it was written, how much is
 *    there), it has ALREADY put them somewhere visible by the time you read it, and every way
 *    out is one click away in the bar itself.
 *
 *  ⛔ THE RECOVERY IS NOT A BUTTON, IT IS DONE. Auto-adoption runs on load, so the note is
 *  reachable before anyone reads this. A "Put it back" the user had to find was one more
 *  chance for a real note to sit lost while a banner talked about it. */
