// Header presence chip — pure data + presentation derivation (B674, rebuilt NEW-1).
//
// Presence rides the SAME per-site realtime channel the element rows stream on (Supabase Realtime
// Presence: each connected client announces itself; the channel keeps a live roster). The chip
// shows only when there is something worth reporting — working alone in one window stays
// chrome-quiet (PANEL-BREVITY's spirit applied to the header, not just panels).
//
// presenceState() shape (supabase-js): { [presenceKey]: [meta, meta, ...] } — one key per tracked
// IDENTITY (we key by uid), one meta per connected SESSION (window/tab/device) under that key. That
// is already the answer to "which sessions are MINE": every session sharing this account's uid is
// one of this account's own tabs, and every OTHER key is a genuinely different signed-in person —
// no second backend, no per-session identity to invent, it was already there in the grouping.
//
// ⛔ THE BUG THIS REBUILD FIXES (owner report, "4 people here" with one account, several tabs open):
// the previous `presenceSummary` folded every connected session — self's own extra tabs included —
// into one people-shaped count ("N here"), so Michael's own second and third tab read as strangers.
// B674 had already fixed the undercount half of this (two windows of one account must not disappear
// as "alone"); this fixes the OTHER half — those extra windows must not read as OTHER PEOPLE either.

// B472048 (NEW-7 · NEW-2) — "who is here" answered WHO; this answers "and what were they doing".
// Hovering a presence chip is the one moment the owner is already looking at someone else's
// presence, so it is where "what has X been doing" belongs — rather than a second surface nobody
// opens. `lastOpByUid` is keyed the same way presence already groups sessions (by account uid, not
// by the finer-grained per-tab actor_session_id the write path stamps): two windows of one
// teammate already collapse into that teammate's ONE `others` entry (`windows: 2`), so "their last
// operation" is naturally a per-PERSON fact here, not a per-tab one — asking which of their tabs
// did it is a question this chip was never going to answer anyway. Caller-tracked (from realtime
// site_elements rows; see SitePlanner.jsx), because this module stays pure/DOM-free.
//   lastOpByUid: Map|object, uid -> { opKind, at } — `at` a comparable value (epoch ms recommended)
//
// presenceParties(state, selfUid, lastOpByUid) → null (nothing to show) or:
//   { selfWindows, others, totalSessions }
//     selfWindows   — how many of THIS account's own sessions are connected right now (>=1 when
//                     any are; the caller is one of them)
//     others        — one entry per OTHER real person present, alphabetized by display name/email:
//                     { uid, name, email, windows, lastOp } — name/email are `null` when the
//                     session never announced one; `lastOp` is `{opKind, at}` or `null` when
//                     nothing has been seen from them yet this page load (never a guess).
//     totalSessions — every connected session, self's included
// Returns null when there is only one session total (this window, alone, nothing else open) —
// the one case with nothing to report.
