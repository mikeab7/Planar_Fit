/* compsCardModel — pure model behind the Dashboard's Comps card (NEW-COMPS-CARD). The card itself
 * (components/CompsCard.jsx) is a dumb renderer over what this module computes, same "pure model +
 * dumb renderer" split every other visualization in this repo follows (site-planner/lib/yieldBar.js
 * is the precedent cited when this was built) — so the peer-set rule, the scale geometry and the
 * comparison sentence are all unit-testable without a browser or a network call.
 *
 * WHY A CARD REPLACES A COUNT: a raw "N comps recorded" reads the same every morning and tells the
 * owner nothing actionable — the count only changes when HE adds one. Showing the most recently
 * added comp, placed against its real peers, is a fact that's actually new each time he looks.
 *
 * THE PEER-SET RULE, stated once here because every other function in this file exists to serve
 * it: peers are comps of the SAME comp type, in the SAME county, in a COMPARABLE SIZE BAND, and
 * ON THE SAME MEASURING SCALE as the featured comp — never a blend across counties, deal types,
 * wildly different building sizes, or incompatible scales, and never an average of every comp the
 * owner has ever entered. A comp missing a county or a resolvable size can never join the peer set
 * (there's nothing honest to compare it on) — it's EXCLUDED and counted, never silently dropped or
 * averaged in.
 *
 * ⛔ "ON THE SAME MEASURING SCALE" IS THE HALF THIS FILE SHIPPED WITHOUT, and it produced two
 * absurd cards on real data (adversarial review, 2026-09-08 — reproduce with
 * `ui-audit/review-2026-09-08/probe-comps-peer-set.mjs`):
 *   · A LEASE's rate means nothing without its expense basis. An $11 gross rate and a $5 NNN rate
 *     are the same deal; plotted on one rule they read as a 2× spread. `shared/comps/lib/comps.js`'s
 *     `summarizeLeaseComps` already refuses to blend NNN with gross ("there is no honest conversion
 *     between them without the underlying expense figures the app doesn't have") — the peer set now
 *     enforces the identical rule instead of quietly disagreeing with it.
 *   · A LAND comp's headline rate is quoted in its OWN recorded unit — $/AC or $/SF — and those are
 *     43,560× apart. Two identically-priced 20-acre tracts, one entered in acres and one in SF,
 *     shared a scale and produced the sentence "$129996.90 above the median".
 * A comp that would otherwise have been a peer (same type, county and band) but sits on a different
 * scale is EXCLUDED and counted — never rescaled into agreement, because the conversion that would
 * make it agree is exactly the one the app cannot honestly perform.
 *
 * ⛔ AND THE PERIOD THE CARD SPEAKS IN IS NAMED, NOT IMPLIED, AND — since the period toggle (see
 * `components/CompsCard.jsx`) — IT IS MICHAEL'S CHOICE, NOT A HARDCODED CONSTANT. Lease rates are
 * entered monthly OR annually, per comp; Michael's own account holds both. Every figure this card
 * renders — the featured headline, every peer dot, both scale ticks and the comparison sentence —
 * passes through ONE normalization to ONE period (`period`, threaded through every function
 * below, defaulting to `DEFAULT_LEASE_PERIOD`), so no two numbers on this card can ever be in
 * different periods — they just may now both be monthly instead of both annual. It used to be
 * true only because `annualLeaseRate` happened to be the only rate function in reach; nothing
 * said so, and nothing would have caught it changing.
