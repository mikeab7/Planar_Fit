 * a count, so it needs every comp's full row (county, size, rate, dates) rather than just
 * `comp_type` — reuses `shared/comps/lib/compsStore.js`'s `fetchAllComps()` (the same canonical
 * read every other comp consumer in the app uses) rather than a second, narrower select that could
 * drift from it. The derivation itself (which comp is featured, who its peers are, the sentence)
 * is pure and lives in `lib/compsCardModel.js` — this file only fetches.
