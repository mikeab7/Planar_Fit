/* Map notes — the WIRING rules, asserted on the real source (NEW-1).
 *
 * These are the three properties that cannot be checked from the pure modules alone, and each one
 * is a defect this repo has already paid for once:
 *  1. ONE placement mechanism, not two. The brief's own words: "generalise the naming where you
 *     touch it rather than cloning a second parallel mechanism — a second copy of this is how the
 *     two comp-anchor paths got out of step before (HARDENING-12)."
 *  2. What is PAINTED is gated on its own layer checkbox and NOTHING else — B831778's decoupling
 *     rule ("If selecting the Comps tab hides site pins, the design has failed"), which the notes
 *     layer now has to obey too.
 *  3. DELETE IS SOFT. A hard delete of a note would be unrecoverable and silent.
