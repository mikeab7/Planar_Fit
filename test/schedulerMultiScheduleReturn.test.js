/* NEW-1 — recurrence of B1080547 ("Allow multiple schedules per project"). Owner report,
 * verbatim, 2026-09-07: "how come I still can't make multiple schedules per project?"
 *
 * MEASURED ON PRODUCTION: his Goose Creek project carried FOUR linked schedules (pids 1/19/20/21),
 * three of them created minutes apart and still completely empty — the signature of someone
 * pressing "+ New project" repeatedly because nothing they could see had happened. Creation,
 * naming, and linking all already worked (B1080545/B1080547/B1112449/B1112450). The gap: once a
 * site carries several linked schedules, EVERY resolution path that has to pick one of them for
 * you — `planar:nav-select-by-site` (the cross-module carry-in) and `planar:nav-select-task` (the
 * Dashboard's "jump to task" bridge) — used `Object.values(d.projects).find(...)`, which always
 * returns the FIRST match by ascending numeric key, i.e. the OLDEST schedule, regardless of which
 * one was actually last in use. Compounding this: B1107680 (shipped the same week) moved `aPid`
 * out of the versioned cloud document entirely (now per-tab sessionStorage, see
 * public/sequence/index.html's VIEW_TAB_KEYS) — so a genuinely fresh tab/session has NOTHING to
 * fall back on except `Object.values(d.projects)[0]`, the globally-lowest project id. The two gaps
 * compound: any fresh tab routed at a multi-schedule site always lands on the OLDEST schedule,
 * never whichever one was actually being used.
 *
 * Fix: `lastActiveBySite` — a small map kept in the VERSIONED document (deliberately NOT a
 * view-state key, so it survives a brand-new tab) recording which schedule was last made active
 * for each linked site. `withLastActiveSite` is the one place that updates it; `nav-select-by-site`
 * (and `nav-select-task`, the same defect one level up) now prefer it over "whichever sorts
 * first". Live-verified end to end against the real built app in headless Chromium (Supabase
 * stubbed, never touching production) — see the PR body for the transcript; this file pins the
 * pure resolution logic so it can never drift from the code the owner actually runs (same
 * live-extraction pattern as test/schedulerCrossSchedulePaste.test.js).
