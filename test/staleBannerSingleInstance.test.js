/* ROUND EIGHT, NEW-2 (B1482353) — THE STALE-TAB BANNER MUST NEVER STACK.
 *
 * The owner's screenshot: two identical "This tab is out of date — your recent changes here can't
 * be saved. Reload the page to catch up." banners plus a "+1 more" pill, over the canvas and the
 * placement tooltip, on a plan four minutes old with one tab and one account. `TOAST_CAP` is 2,
 * so "+1 more" means exactly THREE were pushed — which matches the telemetry precisely
 * (`element-assembly-split-unresolved` at streaks 4, 5 and 6; see elementSyncConvergence.test.js
 * for the full trace and the DB read that proves the single writer).
 *
 * This file guards the DISPLAY half, which is deliberately independent of the engine half: NEW-2
 * is shippable even if a root cause is not fully closed, so the invariant "at most one of these
 * exists at any time" must hold no matter how many times anything decides to raise it.
