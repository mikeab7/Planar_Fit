/* NEW-2 (B848832, owner report 2026-09-04) — "a soft-deleted project stays fully open and
 * writable, and its breadcrumb degrades to the placeholder word Project."
 *
 * The route-level fix (Shell.jsx swapping in DeletedProjectNotice instead of mounting the
 * workspace) can only be proven live, signed in, against a real soft-deleted row — this sandbox
 * cannot sign in to Supabase (Blocker: auth), and confirming it needs the exact owner-reported
 * project, not a synthetic one (Blocker: real-data). Both are filed as V### live-verify steps.
 *
 * What IS fully provable here, headless and Node-only: the GROUP-level deletion check the whole
 * gate is built on (`cloudCheckDeleted`) answers every shape of a project's rows correctly, and
 * the `checkProjectDeletionStatus` wrapper Shell.jsx actually calls fails OPEN whenever the answer
 * is inconclusive (signed out, a thrown error, a pre-migration DB) — the property STANDING RULE
 * demands: never block a route on an absence of information, only on a proven fact.
 *
 * Mock the supabase client (same pattern as test/cloudListIdIntegrity.test.js) so this runs with
 * no network/config. Hoisted holder — a vi.mock factory can't close over a normal top-level var.
 * `h.rows` is the in-memory `sites` table: `cloudCheckDeleted` (B1164192) asks it TWICE — once by
 * `id`, once by `group_id` — since a project is every row sharing a group, not the single row
 * whose id happens to equal it (see that function's own header).

/* B1202176 ×2 (recurrence, owner chat 2026-09-05) — "a new project persists its child data but
 * never itself, so a reload loses the lot." The first B1202176 fix only taught the gate to
 * TOLERATE a freshly-minted id for the life of the session (`freshlyCreated`, proven above) — it
 * never made the project's own `sites` row actually exist. So a project used from a NON-Site
 * module (Model/Notes/Review/Library) — never touching the Site Planner canvas — still had no
 * `sites` row, and the tolerance is wiped by a reload (a fresh page load has no session memory),
 * at which point `checkProjectDeletionStatus` finds nothing and the gate blocks the workspace
 * exactly as before, regardless of how much child data survived elsewhere.
 *
 * Landed CONCURRENTLY with an independent session's B1160480 (same root cause, found via the
 * Library-upload angle), which shipped `storage.js`'s `ensureProjectRow` — the more complete
 * implementation (it also refuses a genuinely soft-deleted project rather than silently
 * resurrecting it) — with its own thorough suite in `test/ensureProjectRow.test.js`. This block
 * does not re-prove that function's own logic; it proves the ONE thing that suite cannot, because
 * it mocks `cloudSync.js` directly rather than the real `supabase.js` client: that `ensureProjectRow`'s
 * write is what a SUBSEQUENT, INDEPENDENT `checkProjectDeletionStatus` call — made with
 * `freshlyCreated: false`, the honest post-reload state with no session memory at all — needs to
 * resolve the project LIVE. A test that only checked the gate against a PRE-EXISTING row (seeded
 * by the mock, never actually written by this code) would pass on the broken behaviour; this one
 * writes the row through the real `ensureProjectRow` → `saveSite` → `pushSiteToCloud` →
 * `cloudUpsert` path and reads it back through the real `checkProjectDeletionStatus` →
 * `cloudCheckDeleted` path — the same two functions the app actually calls — via ONE stateful
 * mock of the Supabase client that an INSERT genuinely makes visible to a later SELECT.
 *
 * NOTE — this is a DIFFERENT, complementary mechanism from the sibling "B1202176 (extended)"
 * describe block below (`markProjectFreshlyMinted`/`wasProjectFreshlyMinted`): that one persists
 * the SESSION-MEMORY grace across a reload/new tab (still no real row, just a longer-lived flag);
 * this one makes the row genuinely EXIST, so neither mechanism needs to fire at all once a module
 * has actually saved something. Both are real fixes for different gaps and neither makes the
 * other redundant — a project that mints an id and is then abandoned with zero content anywhere
 * never gets an `ensureProjectRow` row (by design, per the lazy-creation model), so
 * `markProjectFreshlyMinted`'s grace is still what carries it across a reload for however long
 * its cap allows. */

/* B1202176 (extended, 2026-09-05) — THE RELOAD REPRO. `freshProjectIdsRef`/`locallyMintedGroupsRef`
 * are plain in-memory Sets, scoped to one Shell/SitePlannerApp mount; they cannot answer for an id
 * minted in an EARLIER mount. Live repro on production (build 59d08b4, which already contains
 * #1451/#1457): loading bare https://planyr.io/ restored `planyr:lastRoute:v1` pointing at project
 * id `smtouazufbss`, which has NO row in `public.sites` at all — not present, not soft-deleted —
 * because "New project" mints an id and writes it into `lastRoute` on navigation, but (by design —
 * see SitePlannerApp.jsx's `newBlankSite`) saves NOTHING anywhere until the first draw. Closing the
 * tab before drawing anything and reopening the bare domain restores that id into a BRAND-NEW Shell
 * mount, whose `freshProjectIdsRef` is an empty Set — the exact same `{exists:false}` answer as the
 * original bug, now reading "missing" again.
 *
 * `markProjectFreshlyMinted`/`wasProjectFreshlyMinted` are the small, capped, localStorage-backed
 * twin of that in-memory Set — written at the same two mint sites, read regardless of which mount
 * (or tab) asks. This proves the actual cross-mount sequence the earlier tests in this file cannot:
 * mint in one "mount" (write only the persisted store, never touching the in-memory ref), then ask
 * in a SECOND, freshly-constructed in-memory Set (a fresh mount/reload) whether the combined
 * `freshlyCreated` signal — exactly what Shell.jsx now computes — still resolves the gate to "live".
