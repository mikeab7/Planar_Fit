/* parcel-source-health-sweep.mjs — B1461730: a periodic health check over every WIRED parcel
 * source in counties.js, so a source that has quietly gone empty is caught by a scheduled build
 * rather than by Michael clicking on a map. (Same shape/purpose as gis-verify/gis-source-
 * coverage-verify.mjs — the drainage/utility screening registry's own weekly drift check — but
 * that verifier reads a completely different registry, src/shared/gis/sources.js, which carries
 * no parcel rows; this is the parcel registry's equivalent.)
 *
 * THE CASE THIS WAS BUILT FOR. Nevada's wired parcel layer went from 1,394,188 features to ZERO
 * layers overnight — the app itself never noticed (nothing in the runtime asks "does this source
 * still have data" unprompted; a click either finds a parcel or it doesn't, and a whole county
 * going dark reads the same as a click landing on a gap between two tracts). This script asks
 * that question directly, for every wired source, on a schedule.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHECKS, for every DISTINCT `layerUrl` in COUNTIES + COUNTIES_MAP (site-planner/lib/
 * counties.js — deduped, since many county keys point at one shared statewide layer):
 *   • metadata + count query both answer without an ArcGIS `{error}` body (B1461729's fix,
 *     via serviceNeighbourWalk.mjs's shared `measureParcelLayer`);
 *   • the layer has at least one feature (a service that answers cleanly but reports 0 features
 *     is the same "quietly gone empty" failure as a hard error).
 * A `serviceUrl`-only entry (no direct `layerUrl` — the app auto-resolves its layer at request
 * time) is skipped by this pass; every currently-wired statewide source and the great majority of
 * county CADs use `layerUrl` directly, so this is real coverage, not a token check, but it is not
 * exhaustive — say so rather than claim otherwise.
 *
 * ON A FAILURE, this walks the failed source's own REST server for a replacement
 * (serviceNeighbourWalk.mjs's `walkForReplacement`) and includes what it found in the report —
 * exactly what would have caught the Nevada rename the same day it happened. No persisted
 * "last-known-good" baseline exists yet (a future enhancement), so a walked candidate is reported
 * as a name-similarity match for a human to confirm, never auto-applied.
 *
 * Reuses probe-statewide-parcels.mjs's own `fetchJson` — the SAME per-host throttle + circuit
 * breaker (B1461731) as every other probe/discovery script in this folder, so a sweep over ~150+
 * sources backs off from a struggling host instead of hammering it.
 *
 * Exit 0 = every checked source answered with real data. Exit 1 = at least one did not (the
 * scheduled workflow turns that into a @claude GitHub issue, same shape as gis-drift.yml).
 *
 *   node ui-audit/parcel-source-health-sweep.mjs
